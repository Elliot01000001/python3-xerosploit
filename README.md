# python3-xeroxploit

First thing's first please visit https://github.com/LionSec/xerosploit and download tools folder as I cannot upload it due to itthe number of files :(

Install the following Dependencies -

nmap
hping3
build-essential
ruby-dev
libpcap-dev
libgmp3-dev
tabulate
terminaltables

sudo apt install nmap hping3 build-essential libpcap-dev libgmp3-dev

pip3 install tabulate
pip3 install terminaltables


To install xerosploit, simply type --> sudo python3 install.py

Wait for some time, Done!

All I did it changed raw_input to input (input is for python3 and raw_input is for python2) in install.py && xerosploit.py and edited run.sh to sudo python3 (everything else is default)

If you still want the tools folder, I am here to make your life easy :P --> Here is the link for it https://www.mediafire.com/file/dc797mlqc41gw5a/tools.zip/file

Unzip --> Move it to python3-xerosploit and you are done :D

After the installation, type xerosploit in your terminal and everything will work fine :)

All the credits to LionSec and Me ofcourse :P
